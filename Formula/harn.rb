  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Harn is pre-release software and is not yet supported.

      Expect breaking changes between releases, including to the command line
      interface and to on-disk formats. There is no compatibility guarantee
      between any two versions, and no support channel.

      Releases move quickly. Run `brew upgrade harn` often; an install left
      alone for a few days is likely to be several releases behind.
