## Pull request titles

Use `[Area] Sentence case`. The area is one of `Formula`, `CI`, or `Docs`.

- `[Formula] Use pkgshare in the generated burin formula`
- `[CI] Stop reporting green on a head-only formula smoke`
- `[Docs] Say which install channel is gated before launch`

Keep the title on one line, under about 70 characters. Say what changed, not
which files moved. Capitalize the first word after the bracket and leave the
rest in sentence case.

`CONTRIBUTING.md` states the contribution policy for this repository.

## Ecosystem working agreement

- Pursue the ambitious product outcome; make the seams boring with small typed
  interfaces, explicit invariants, and deterministic projections.
- Give each behavior one semantic owner. Generate or parity-test other surfaces
  instead of maintaining competing implementations.
- Work autonomously inside approved scope. Pause for destructive, production,
  high-spend, ambiguous, or authority-expanding actions—not routine reversible work.
- Treat stop, wait, stand down, and pivot as control events for long-lived work.
- Match evidence to the claim: exercise the canonical user path, state the
  falsifier, verify liveness and recovery, and record residual blind spots.
- "Ship" means landed on main with required deploy and post-merge checks complete.
